Description:

The dataset:

This program is intended to be used to explore the Ontario Provincial Water Quality Monitoring Network (PWQMN) data, which is generated by the Ontario Ministry of Environment (MOE) (Ontario Ministry of Environment and Climate Change). The PWQMN network data is generated by a program involving the MOE and the 31 Ontario Conservation authorities of Ontario, and is publicly available online (http://www.ontario.ca/data/provincial-stream-water-quality-monitoring-network), governed by an open licence (http://www.ontario.ca/government/open-government-licence-ontario).

The PWQMN dataset currently contains roughly 100 chemical, biological and physical parameters measured on roughly 2000 stations on roughly 800 rivers and streams throughout all of Ontario, and has a data beginning in the mid 1960s, though only data since 2000 is available to the public via the MOE website. The MOE have a mandate to monitor and publish data relevant to the determination of many aspects of water quality, river and stream ecosystem status, and the general "health" of all Ontario ecosystems. As far as environmental datasets are concerned, the PWQMN dataset is a large and compressive set, it covers a much larger spatial and temporal scale, and include many more parameters than a typical environmental study. Thus, it offers opportunities for data mining and exploration to discover patterns that may not have been previously realized, or because of the volume of data, too small to otherwise detect.

As the data is published near-annually as it becomes available, in Microsoft Excel spreadsheets (and Microsoft Access databases), and due to the format of the row entries of the data, I have found that data exploration strictly using Microsoft products is not productive, and extracting very specific pieces of information is time consuming and prone to errors. Thus I have developed a tool which provides easy access to the dataset for extracting some basic and specific information useful in data exploration and data mining. Future updates to this program will build on these basics and increase the statiscal and graphical tools available to users.



The program:

Currently, the program is a python script that communicates with R. Anyone wishing to use this program must have the following installed on their system:

- Python
- The python library: rpy2 (http://rpy.sourceforge.net/)
- R (statistical programming language)
- The R library: ggplot2 (http://ggplot2.org/)

The version of this program will have these dependency issues removed.
