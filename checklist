Checklist for next version:

- import and test for all data

Program should have:
- implement year selection option
- implement select all parameters option (in sparm)
- implement select all stations option (in sel)
- verbose option for list (ls) command. See site descriptions, 
	lat and lon, paramter descriptions and units
- round summary stats based on significant digits


Nice to have:
- no case sensitivity
- put summary stats on graphs
- append cities to selection (instead of only generating a new selection)
