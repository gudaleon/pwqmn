Checklist for next version:
(in the order that I will probably do them)

Program should have:
--------------------
- implement export of selected data table (so selection cab be imported to R separately)
- implement year selection option 
- implement select all parameters option (in sparm)
- implement select all stations option (in sel)
- verbose option for list (ls) command. See site descriptions, 
	lat and lon, parameter descriptions and units

- summary stats:
	-compare years, months, rivers (rank-sum test) for selected parameters
	
- round summary stats based on significant digits
- no requirement for dependents
- do not load all data into memory. Start by loading only what is selected.
- deal with threshold data appropriately

Nice to have:
--------------
- no case sensitivity
- put summary stats on graphs
- append cities to selection (instead of only generating a new selection)
